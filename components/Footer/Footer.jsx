      For this final section, I think it's best to end with the question of "why
      hire me?". I've already mentioned that I'm a forever student & that
      customer service & technology have been at the forefront of my
      professional career, but more than that, I've worked with & talked to a
      lot of different people from many different cultures & walks of life. I
      believe I will be a valuable asset in regard to being teachable without
      being arrogant, collabrative without being controlling, communicative
      without being condecending & if put in a position of power, firm without
      being overbearing.Thank you for taking the time to visit my website & for
      giving me an opportunity to work for you. <br />
