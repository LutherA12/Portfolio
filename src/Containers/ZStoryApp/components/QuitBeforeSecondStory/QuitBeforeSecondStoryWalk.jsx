      You decide to leave. You've had an eerie feeling this entire time due to
      the lack of traffic and overall oddness of this shopping trip. "It's way
      too quite for a Saturday afternoon" you think to yourself. As you return
      home you find yourself walking past your neighbors house. You don't see

      seems to be torn and his house seems a bit messy. What your neighbor was
      doing you will never know and is of little concequence right now. You put
      your keys down, sit on the couch, turn on the TV and CRASH!!! "What in the
      hell?! Sounds like my kitchen window has been broken!", you get up and run
      into your kitchen and there it is, staring at you...
