      You turn and run, "fuck this!" you exclaim, however, you now notice these
      things are everywhere! "This is real stupid" you say to yourself "now I
      need to get away!". You run to the other end of the aisle remembering that
      you are parked outside, however once you get there and look, the store
      entrance is crawling with these things! There are a lot of them over
      there! <br />
      <br /> You look toward the back of the store and it's clear at least for
      now, plus you're pretty sure you heard other people and carts while you
      were shopping. Maybe there is a security room that others are safely held
      up in? Maybe they have their cellphones since you forgot yours at home.
      Maybe, you can find some help.
