      "Driving sounds best" you think to yourself, besides you already have your
      keys with you and plenty of gas. While driving you notice there isn't any
      traffic which is a bit odd since its about 2:00pm and its Saturday. You're
      also making great time, but that's because many of the traffic lights are
      not working. Some are blinking yellow and others are blinking red. "This
      is pretty weird" you think to yourself, but you shrug it off as you pull
      into the store parking lot to look for a shopping cart...
