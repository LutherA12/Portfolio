      You decide to leave. You've had an eerie feeling this entire time due to
      the lack of traffic and overall oddness of this shopping trip. "It's way
      too quite for a Saturday afternoon" you think to yourself. As you return
      home you don't see your neighbor anymore. What your neighbor was doing you

      your kitchen and there it is, staring at you...
