      You rush him pushing the shopping cart that have into his mid section
      knocking him down and almost running him over. "Son of a bitch!", you
      exclaim "You're lucky I don't kick your --" but before you can finish, you
      notice these things are everywhere now! "This is real stupid" you say to
      yourself "now I need to get away!". You run to the other end of the aisle
      remembering that you are parked outside, however once you get there and
      look, the store entrance is crawling with these things! There are a lot of
      them over there! <br />
      <br /> You look toward the back of the store and it's clear at least for
      now, plus you're pretty sure you heard other people and carts while you
      were shopping. Maybe there is a security room that others are safely held
      up in? Maybe they have their cellphones since you forgot yours at home.
      Maybe, you can find some help.
